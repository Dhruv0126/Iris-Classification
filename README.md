#Iris Classification

This project, "Iris Classification", demonstrates a machine learning model to classify Iris flower species using popular Python libraries such as TensorFlow, pandas, scikit-learn, and seaborn. The Iris dataset is a classic example in the field of pattern recognition and machine learning, often used for testing and benchmarking machine learning algorithms.

#Technologies Used

- **TensorFlow**: Utilized for building, training, and evaluating machine learning models.
- **pandas**: Used for data manipulation and preprocessing of the Iris dataset.
- **scikit-learn**: Employed for model evaluation, metrics computation, and data preprocessing tasks.
- **seaborn**: Used for visualizing data distributions and relationships within the Iris dataset.
